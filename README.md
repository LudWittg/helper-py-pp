# Use Z3Py in the browser with Pyodide

This repository (momentarely) implements a demo/experiment that displays the usage of the z3-solver with Python binding directly in the browser. It's a work in progress. The end goal is using this project to optimize, directly on the web client side, the helpers' schedule in a conference.
This project uses Astro (with bun) for the front end alongside Pyodide with wasm to run Python.
